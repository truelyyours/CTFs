Question:
We created a custom random number generator using XOR-Shift to help us generate pseudorandom numbers. THere may have been an issue with our initialization. Here are the first 5 generated values. Can you predict the next one?

The flag is: jctfv{Predictable_PRNG_Rizzed}

Essentially, you have to try all 1 to 32 values for a,b,c. Usually the order ir left right left shift so keeping the order life that is fine.

Over tries, it will be found that 13 left, 7 right, 17 left works. Remember to & 0xffffffff after each left shift else the number will grow beyong 32 bits!
